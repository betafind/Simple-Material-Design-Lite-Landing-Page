# Material Design Lite Landing Page
This is a simple landing page that was created by adapting the MDL stand-alone article template.  The form stores all the information in Firebase.

## Summary
You can take this repo and do really whatever you want to have a quick landing page for your website.  The data from the form goes directly into a Firebase repo.

##Issues
The one problem I had with MDL is the form is rendered as is-invalid onload if the input is required.  So I changed some parts of the CSS just so it looks slightly better but it still doesn't look like a proper text field in MDL onload.  To get true MDL text fields you can remove the required attribute.
